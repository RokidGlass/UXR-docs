# UXR Dock SDK

essential XR features, such as:

    * Motion tracking
    * Stereoscopic rendering

* With these capabilities you can build entirely new XR experiences, or enhance
existing apps with XR capabilities.

* This Unity SDK sample demonstrates the usage of the features mentioned above by some scenes:
     * HeadTracking scene  
   shows usage of 3 dof head tracking, and stereoscopic rendering for glass
     * VoiceRecog scene  
   shows usage of rokid voice recognition(offline voice instruction for Chinese and English)
	 * GestureRecog scene  
   shows usage of rokid gesture recognition(Four types of 2D gestures at present)
